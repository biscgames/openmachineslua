# OpenMachines
OpenMachines is an open-source game about machinery. This md will show you how to play the game!</br>
## Beginning
There are a few deposits scrambled around the game. To start, you can add an extractor below it. Then a switch at the left of the extractor, and a storage at the right for it to store the items</br>

<br/>(or you can left-click on an empty grid element, then go to the shop and click on the machine you want. Instant)<br/>
Your machines should look something like this

<br/>First, right-click on the switches, to turn them on. There is a 5 second timer that the game relies on to progress.
<br/>After items were extracted you can right-click the storage machines to grab all of them
